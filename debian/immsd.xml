A manual page <package>.<section> will be generated. You may view the
manual page with: nroff -man <package>.<section> | less'. A typical entry
in a Makefile or Makefile.am is:

DB2MAN = /usr/share/sgml/docbook/stylesheet/xsl/nwalsh/manpages/docbook.xsl
XP     = xsltproc -''-nonet -''-param man.charmap.use.subset "0"

manpage.1: manpage.xml
        $(XP) $(DB2MAN) $<

The xsltproc binary is found in the xsltproc package. The XSL files are in
docbook-xsl. A description of the parameters you can use can be found in the
docbook-xsl-doc-* packages. Please remember that if you create the nroff
version in one of the debian/rules file targets (such as build), you will need
to include xsltproc and docbook-xsl in your Build-Depends control field.
Alternatively use the xmlto command/package. That will also automatically
pull in xsltproc and docbook-xsl.

Notes for using docbook2x: docbook2x-man does not automatically create the
AUTHOR(S) and COPYRIGHT sections. In this case, please add them manually as
<refsect1> ... </refsect1>.

To disable the automatic creation of the AUTHOR(S) and COPYRIGHT sections
read /usr/share/doc/docbook-xsl/doc/manpages/authors.html. This file can be
found in the docbook-xsl-doc-html package.

Validation can be done using: `xmllint -''-noout -''-valid manpage.xml`
